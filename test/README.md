This directory contains regression tests.  Running `make` produces out/demo-*.pdf files that you may inspect visually.  Versioned pandoc and python executables must on your path (see the Makefile).

Note that the spacing in the output pdf files varies because of pandoc.  Everything else should visually remain the same.
