pandoc-fignos 0.18
==================

*pandoc-fignos* is a [pandoc] filter for numbering figures and figure references in markdown documents.

Demonstration: Processing [demo.md] with `pandoc --filter pandoc-fignos` gives numbered figures and references in [pdf], [tex], [html], [epub], [md] and other formats.

This version of pandoc-fignos was tested using pandoc 1.15 - 1.18.  It works under linux, Mac OS X and Windows.  Older versions and other platforms can be supported on request.  I am pleased to receive bug reports and feature requests on the project's [Issues tracker].

If you find pandoc-fignos useful, please encourage further development by giving it a star [on GitHub].

Rationale
---------

Figure numbers and references are frequently used in academic writing, but are not supported natively by pandoc.  Pandoc-fignos is an add-on filter that provides the missing functionality.

The markdown syntax recognized by pandoc-fignos was developed in [pandoc Issue #813] -- see [this post] by [@scaramouche1].  It seems likely that this will be close to what pandoc ultimately adopts.  Pandoc-fignos is a transitional package for those who need figure numbers and references now.

Usage
-----

To apply the filter to a document, use the following option with pandoc:

    --filter pandoc-fignos

Note that any use of `--filter pandoc-citeproc` or `--bibliography=FILE` should come *after* the pandoc-fignos filter call.

Another note: use of `caption` package is required `\usepackage{caption}`.


Markdown Syntax
---------------

To number a figure, add the label `fig:id` to its attributes:

    ![Caption.](image.png){#fig:id}

The prefix `#fig:` is required. `id` should be replaced with a unique identifier composed of letters, numbers, dashes, slashes and underscores.  If `id` is omitted then the figure will be numbered but unreferenceable.

Alternatively, use attributed links:

    ![Caption.][link]

    [link]: image.png {#fig:id}

To reference the figure, use

    @fig:id

or

    {@fig:id}

Curly braces around a reference are stripped from the output.

Demonstration: Processing [demo.md] with `pandoc --filter pandoc-fignos` gives numbered figures and references in [pdf], [tex], [html], [epub], [md] and other formats.


#### Clever References ####

Writing markdown like

    See fig. @fig:id.

seems a bit redundant.  Pandoc-fignos supports "clever referencing" via single-character modifiers in front of a reference.  You can write

     See +@fig:id.

to have the reference name (i.e., "fig.") automatically generated.  The above form is used mid-sentence.  At the beginning of a sentence, use

     *@fig:id

instead.  If clever referencing is enabled by default (see [Customization](#customization), below), you can disable it for a given reference using

    !@fig:id

Demonstration: Processing [demo2.md] with `pandoc --filter pandoc-fignos` gives numbered figures and references in [pdf][pdf2], [tex][tex2], [html][html2], [epub][epub2], [md][md2] and other formats.

Note: If you use `*fig:id` and emphasis (e.g., `*italics*`) in the same sentence, then you must backslash escape the `*` in the clever reference; e.g., `\*fig:id`.

Note: The disabling modifier "!" is used instead of "-" because [pandoc unnecessarily drops minus signs] in front of references.

#### Tagged Figures ####

You may optionally override the figure number by placing a tag in a figure's attributes block as follows:

    ![Caption.](image.png){#fig:id tag="B.1"}

The tag may be arbitrary text, or an inline equation such as `$\mathrm{B.1'}$`.  Mixtures of the two are not currently supported.


Customization
-------------

To make caption bold as ACM style suggests include caption package with bold font: `\usepackage[font=bf,skip=\baselineskip]{caption}`.

Pandoc-fignos may be customized by setting variables in the [metadata block] or on the command line (using `-M KEY=VAL`).  The following variables are supported:

  * `fignos-caption-name` - Sets the name at the beginning of a
    caption (e.g., change it from "Figure to "Fig." or "å›¾");

  * `fignos-cleveref` or just `cleveref` - Set to `On` to assume "+"
    clever references by default;

  * `fignos-plus-name` - Sets the name of a "+" reference 
    (e.g., change it from "fig." to "figure"); and

  * `fignos-star-name` - Sets the name of a "*" reference 
    (e.g., change it from "Figure" to "Fig.").

  * `xnos-cleveref-fake` - Sets cleveref faking On/Off (LaTeX/pdf
    only).  See [Technical Details](#technical-details), below.

Demonstration: Processing [demo3.md] with `pandoc --filter pandoc-fignos` gives numbered figures and references in [pdf][pdf3], [tex][tex3], [html][html3], [epub][epub3], [md][md3] and other formats.

Technical Details
-----------------

For TeX/pdf output:

  * The `\label` and `\ref` macros are used for figure labels and
    references;
  * `\figurename` is set for the caption name;
  * Tags are supported by temporarily redefining `\thefigure` 
    around a figure; and
  * The clever referencing macros `\cref` and `\Cref` are used
    if they are available (i.e. included in your LaTeX template via
    `\usepackage{cleveref}`), otherwise they are faked.  Set the 
    meta variable `xnos-cleveref-fake` to `Off` to disable cleveref
    faking.

For all other formats the numbers, caption name, and clever references are hard-coded into the output.

Links are constructed for both html and pdf output.


Installation
------------

Pandoc-fignos requires [python], a programming language that comes pre-installed on linux and Mac OS X, and which is easily installed on Windows.  Either python 2.7 or 3.x will do.

[python]: https://www.python.org/


#### Standard installation ####

Install pandoc-fignos as root using the shell command

    pip install pandoc-fignos 

To upgrade to the most recent release, use

    pip install --upgrade pandoc-fignos 

Pip is a program that downloads and installs modules from the Python Package Index, [PyPI].  It should come installed with your python distribution.

[PyPI]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi


#### Installing on linux ####

If you are running linux, pip may be packaged separately from python.  On Debian-based systems (including Ubuntu), you can install pip as root using

    apt-get update
    apt-get install python-pip

During the install you may be asked to run

    easy_install -U setuptools

owing to the ancient version of setuptools that Debian provides.  The command should be executed as root.  You may now follow the [standard installation] procedure given above.

[standard installation]: #standard-installation


#### Installing on Windows ####

It is easy to install python on Windows.  First, [download] the latest release.  Run the installer and complete the following steps:

 1. Install Python pane: Check "Add Python 3.5 to path" then
    click "Customize installation".

 2. Optional Features pane: Click "Next".

 3. Advanced Options pane: Optionally check "Install for all
    users" and customize the install location, then click "Install".

Once python is installed, start the "Command Prompt" program.  Depending on where you installed python, you may need to elevate your privileges by right-clicking the "Command Prompt" program and selecting "Run as administrator".  You may now follow the [standard installation] procedure given above.  Be sure to close the Command Prompt program when you have finished.
